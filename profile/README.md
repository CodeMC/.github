# CodeMC
[CodeMC.io][website] is a public Jenkins CI Service for Open Source projects.

## What we offer
We offer a free, reliable Jenkins CI Server for Open source projects, allowing you to build and distribute your own open source projects through our Jenkins Server.

We also offer a public Nexus Repository allowing you to distribute your APIs, Wrappers, etc. to others without the need to setting up your own maven server or getting added to Maven Central!

## How to apply
To get yourself added to our Jenkins project will you need to [join our Discord server][discord] and apply with an open source project in the `#request-access` channel.  
We will review your project and approve it, if it follows these basic guidelines:

- Project is public and fully open source
- Project needs to be of use for others and not just yourself (i.e. not just an API for your own plugin creation)
- Project needs to be maintained (Last commit should not be older than 1 month)
- Code should be of decent quality. This is subject to the reviewer and can differ on a case-by-case basis
- The name is apropriate. No racial slurs, insults, etc.
- Project needs a README written in english

If those criterias fit your project should you be able to apply without issues!

> **Notes:**  
> You only need to apply once with a project. After you have been approved can you create additional projects at your own discretion. Abuse of this priviledge gets your account removed and your existing projects deleted.  
> You need to apply again if you want an Organisation added to the Site.  
> The above requirements can be subject to change and we reserve the right to change them unannounced.
